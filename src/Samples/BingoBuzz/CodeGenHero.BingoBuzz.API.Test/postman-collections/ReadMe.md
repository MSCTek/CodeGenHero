# Postman Collections for testing Web API



These files were originally contributed by Nik Patel (@PatelNik7) as part of a presentation to the Chicago .NET Users Group (CNUG).  Here is a link to [Nik's slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ANXsVlurSqOb8knewoSKOaGfWWPGEqRm).



Nik demonstrated things like:

  - Creating collections to organize tests into workflows

  - Using variables for things like request headers

  - Using different environments within Postman to change settings

  - Using Newman for integrating Postman tests into a continuous integration / continuous deployment process

### Usage

  - Import the json files into Postman
